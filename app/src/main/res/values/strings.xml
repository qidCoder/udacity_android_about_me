        Hi, my name is Shelley and I love developing mobile apps!
        \n\n I changed careers from Mechanical Engineering to Software Engineering.
        \n\n I love crafting such as sewing, watercolor and crochet.
        \n\n I love ice skating (both figure skating and hockey), kayaking and running.
        \n\n I really want to learn to sail one day especially on the Charles River and maybe even with MIT!
        \n\n I can\'t wait to publish my first app
        \n\n I also love attending conventions and networking events.
